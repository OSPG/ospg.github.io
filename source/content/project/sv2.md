#### *Project URL*: [github.com/OSPG/sv2](https://github.com/OSPG/sv2)
#### *Language*: Go
#### *Summary*: An utility to improve the security of a system.

---

SV2 analyzes the current configurations of the system and provides
recommendations to harden it against possible attackers.

Instead of analyze all the system and report all the checks that comply with the
given police AND all the checks that don't comply with it. SV2 should directly
tell which changes should be made to improve the security of the different
components of a system.
