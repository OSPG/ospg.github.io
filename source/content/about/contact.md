If you have any questions regarding this site or the organization you can open
an issue on https://github.com/OSPG/ospg.github.io.

For more informal questions there is an IRC server at mumei.space/6697 for the
OSPG project (it requires SSL). All people that connects to that server should
be automatically joined to #lobby channel.
